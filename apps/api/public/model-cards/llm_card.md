## Key Features

- **Multimodal Understanding:** Processes both text and images
- **Large Context Window:** Supports up to 128K tokens
- **Advanced Reasoning:** Enhanced problem-solving capabilities
- **Vision Capabilities:** Can analyze and describe images

## Capabilities

### Text Understanding
- Complex reasoning and analysis
- Code generation and debugging
- Creative writing
- Technical documentation
- Multi-language support

### Vision Understanding
- Image description and analysis
- Chart and graph interpretation
- Document OCR and extraction
- Visual reasoning tasks
- UI/UX analysis

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|--------------|-------|
