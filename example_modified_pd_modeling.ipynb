        "## Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling - Modified Version\n",
        "- In this project, I will build three **machine learning** models to predict the three components of expected loss in the context of **credit risk modeling** at the **Lending Club** (a peer-to-peer credit company): **Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)**. The expected loss will be the product of these elements: **Expected Loss (EL) = PD * EAD * LGD**.\n",
        "- The PD modelling encompasses an imbalanced binary classification problem with target being **0 in case of non-default and 1 in case of default** (minority class). A Logistic Regression model will be built.\n",
        "- The LGD and EAD modelling encompasses a regression problem with recovery rate and credit conversion factor as dependent variables.\n",
        "- The **solution pipeline** is based on the **crisp-dm** framework."
