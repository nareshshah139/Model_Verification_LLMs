## Update: 2025-10-24

- Scaffolded monorepo: `apps/api` (Next.js), `apps/web` (Vite React), `packages/shared`.
- Added Vercel AI SDK endpoint `apps/api/app/api/analyze/route.ts` for streaming comparison.
- Created ingestion endpoints: `/api/ingest/repo`, `/api/ingest/upload` (skeletons).
- Defined Prisma schema (`apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`) for models, versions, cards, extractions, discrepancies, jobs.
- Added Postgres `docker-compose.yaml` under `infrastructure/`.
- Bootstrapped Python inspector (FastAPI + tree-sitter) in `services/inspector/`.
- Wired basic web app shell with React Router.

Next: finalize Prisma client wiring, implement rules engine, orchestrator, and UI components for discrepancies.

Additional: Marked completed items in `model.plan.md`; wired `/api/models` and `/api/models/[id]/versions` with Prisma; added Discrepancy UI components.
Frontend: Added `ModelDetailPage` and `IngestPage` routes; Models list links to detail; compare prompt file added.
Ingestion: Implemented repo ingestion (shallow clone, persist files/card, inspector run, analysis persist). Upload flow now triggers analysis and returns ok.
Docs: Added `docs/README.md` with dev quickstart using uv and docker.
Notebook support: Added Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) extraction in both repo and upload flows. Notebooks are preserved with full structure (cells, markdown, code, outputs) in `FileBlob.notebookJson`. Code cells are extracted for tree-sitter analysis while maintaining notebook display in UI. Added `NotebookViewer` component and `/api/models/[id]/versions/[versionId]/notebooks` endpoint.
